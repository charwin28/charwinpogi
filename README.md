        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p>I have a deep love for cycling that combines my passion for adventure and the outdoors. There's something freeing about the wind on my face and the rhythm of the pedals beneath me. One of my most memorable rides was a day trip through Atimonan, Quezon, where I explored winding trails and stunning landscapes. I stumbled upon a hidden lake and took a break to soak in the beauty—definitely a moment I won’t forget! I also enjoy participating in local cycling events, where I connect with fellow cyclists and push my limits. Each ride brings new challenges and discoveries, fueling my love for the sport even more.</p>

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p>I’ve always admired basketball for its fast pace and teamwork. Watching games, I love the energy on the court and the thrill of a last-second shot. I’ve enjoyed playing casually with friends, where we share laughs and push each other to improve. Every game teaches something new, whether it’s about strategy, resilience, or just having fun.</p>
